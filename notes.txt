Seems like rust is already installed on this computer, compilation fails due to symbol linking

Internet seems to think it's an incompatibility between the llvm dependency and the brew rust installation.

Going to install from the web using the install script on the home page.

Works

Seems like http is entirely dependent on a package.
Trying to see if there's a net/http equivalent in rust, something in the stdlib so that I don't need to add dependencies

Seems like in order to do http with the stdlib requires socket reading / writing and the old song and dance

Need to setup my development environment for rust

The logo and color kinda suck

Can look into that a bit later

Need to:
 - compile and run
 - test
 - format
 - debug
 - debug test
 - install package
 - create working http

curl -XPOST --data '{"name": "Gerald"}' http://localhost:5151/hello

Debugging works, but only after cargo build.
Cargo run seems to generate unrecognized symbols for lldb.

Strangely cargo build and then running the executable seems to work fine, perhaps becuase the debugger is looking at the executable file

Regardless, this can be mitigated by having a build step in a makefile
